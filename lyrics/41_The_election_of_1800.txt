####Election of 1800####

Ensemble:
The Election of 1800!
Please?

Thomas Jefferson:
Can we get back to politics?
Yo…

Thomas Jefferson:
Every action has its equal opposite reaction
John Adams shat the bed; I love the guy, but he’s in traction
Poor Alexander Hamilton, he is missing in action
So now I’m facing Aaron Burr with his own faction

James Madison:
He’s very attractive in the North, New Yorkers like his chances

Jefferson:
He’s not very forthcoming on any particular stances

Madison:
Ask him a question, it glances off, he obfuscates, he dances

Jefferson:
And they say I’m a Francophile, at least they know I know where France is

Madison:
Thomas, that’s the problem; see, they see Burr as a less extreme you
You need to change course, a key endorsement might redeem you

Jefferson:
Who did you have in mind?

Madison:
Don’t laugh

Jefferson:
Who is it?

Madison:
You used to work on the same staff.

Jefferson:
Whaaaat?

Madison:
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

Jefferson and Madison:
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

Aaron Burr:
Talk less! 
Smile more! 
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for! 
Shake hands with him! 
Charm her!
It’s 1800; ladies, tell your husbands, vote for Burr!

Ensemble:
Burr!
Burr!
Burr!
Burr!
Burr!

Various Ensemble:
I don’t like Adams! 
Well, he’s gonna lose, that’s just defeatist.
And Jefferson? 
In love with France! Yeah, he’s so elitist!
I like that Aaron Burr! 
I can’t believe we’re here with him!
He seems approachable? 
Like you could grab a beer with him

Ensemble:
Dear Mr. Hamilton
Your fellow Federalists would like to know how you’ll be voting
Dear Mr. Hamilton
John Adams doesn’t stand a chance, so who you are you promoting?
Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?
We know, it’s lose/lose
Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?
But if you had to choose…
Dear Mr. Hamilton
John Adams doesn’t stand a chance, so who you are you promoting?
But if you had to choose!

Alexander Hamilton: 
It’s quiet uptown…
It’s quiet uptown…

Hamilton:
Well, if isn’t Aaron Burr, sir.

Burr:
Alexander!

Hamilton:
You’ve created quite a stir, sir.

Burr:
I’m going door to door!


Hamilton:
You’re openly campaigning?

Burr:
Sure!

Hamilton:
That’s new.

Burr:
Honestly, it’s kind of draining


Hamilton:
Burr?

Burr:
Sir?

Hamilton:
Is there anything you wouldn’t do?

Burr:
No, I’m chasing what I want, and you know what?

Hamilton:
What?

Burr:
I learned that from you


Bridge 2: James Madison, Thomas Jefferson and ():

Ensemble:
If you had to choose, if you had to choose…
If you had to choose, if you had to choose…
If you had to choose, if you had to choose…
If you had to choose, if you had to choose…
Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?
Choose, choose, choose!

Madison:
…It’s a tie

Jefferson:
It’s up to the delegates


Jefferson and Madison:
It’s up to Hamilton!

Alexander Hamilton:
Yo
The people are asking to hear my voice
But the country is facing a difficult choice
And you were to ask me who I’d promote…
…Jefferson has my vote
I have never agreed with Jefferson once…
We have fought on like 75 different fronts
But when all said and all is done…
Jefferson has beliefs; Burr has none

Ensemble:
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!


Ensemble:
Ooooh!
Well, I’ll be damned! Well, I’ll be damned!

Jefferson and Madison:
Well, I’ll be damned! Well, I’ll be damned!

Madison:
Hamilton’s on your side

Madison:
And… you won in a landslide

Burr:
Congrats on a race well won
I did give you a fight.

Jefferson:
Uh-huh…

Burr:
I look forward to our partnership.

Jefferson:
Our partnership?

Burr:
As your vice president!

Jefferson:
(laughs) Yeah, right!

Jefferson:
You hear this guy?
Man openly campaigns against me, talking ‘bout “I look forward to our partnership!”

Madison:
It is crazy that the guy who comes in second gets to be vice president

Jefferson:
OOOH! Y’know what, we can change that! Y’know why?

Madison:
Why?

Jefferson:
‘Cause I’m the president!
Burr…
When you see Hamilton, thank him for the endorsement.
