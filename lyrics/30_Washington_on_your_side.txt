####Washington On Your Side####

Aaron Burr:
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side

Thomas Jefferson:
Ev'ry action has its equal, opposite reactions.
Thanks to Hamilton, our cabinet’s fractured into factions.
Try not to crack under the stress, we’re breaking down like fractions.
We smack each other in the press, and we don’t print retractions
I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion
The way he primps and preens and dresses like the pits of fashion
Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration
As Wall Street robs ‘em blind in search of chips to cash in
This prick is asking for someone to bring him to task
Somebody give me some dirt on this vacuous mass so we can at last unmask him
I’ll pull the trigger on him, someone load the gun and cock it
While we were all watching, he got Washington in his pocket

Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr and James Madison:
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side
Look back at the Bill of Rights
The ink hasn't dried
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side

James Madison:
which I wrote!

James Madison:
So he’s doubled the size of the government
Wasn't the trouble with much of our previous government size

Aaron Burr:
Look in his eyes, 

Thomas Jefferson:
see how he lies, 

James Madison:
follow the scent of his enterprise

Thomas Jefferson:
Centralizing national credit and making American credit competitive

James Madison:
If we don’t stop it, we aid and abet it.

Thomas Jefferson:
I have to resign!

James Madison:
Somebody has to stand up for the South!

Aaron Burr:
Well, somebody has to stand up to his mouth!

Thomas Jefferson:
If there’s a fire you’re trying to douse, 

Thomas Jefferson and James Madison:
You can’t put it out from inside the house!

Thomas Jefferson:
I’m in the cabinet, I am complicit in watching him grabbin' at power and kiss it.
If Washington isn’t gon’ listen to disciplined dissidents, 
This is the difference, this kid is OUT!

Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr and James Madison:
OH! 
This immigrant isn’t somebody we chose!
OH! 
This immigrant’s keeping us all on our toes!
OH! 
Let’s show these Federalists what they’re up against!
OH! 
Southern motherfucking (uh-huh) Democratic-Republicans!
OH! 
Now follow the money and see where it goes!
OH! 
Because every second, the treasury grows!
OH! 
If we follow the money and see where it leads
Get in the weeds, look for the seeds of Hamilton’s misdeeds!

Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr and James Madison:
It must be nice, it must be nice…
Follow the money and see where it goes!
It must be nice, it must be nice…
The emperor has no clothes
We won’t be invisible
We won’t be denied!
Still…
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side
