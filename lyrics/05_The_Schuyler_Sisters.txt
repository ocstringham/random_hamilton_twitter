####The Schuyler Sisters####

BURR:
There’s nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slumming it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk at the students in the common
Just to watch ‘em talk

Take Philip Schuyler, the man is loaded
Uh oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at

COMPANY:

BURR:
Ooh, there’s nothing like summer in the city
Someone in a rush meets someone looking pretty
Excuse me, miss, I know it’s not funny
But your perfume smells like your daddy’s got money
Why you slummin’ in the city in your fancy heels?
You searchin’ for an urchin who can give you ideals?

ANGELICA: 
Burr, you disgust me

BURR:
Ahh, so you’ve discussed me
I’m a trust fund, baby, you can trust me

ANGELICA:
I’ve been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine
So men say that I’m intense or I’m insane
You want a revolution? I want a revelation
So listen to my declaration

ANGELICA, ELIZA, PEGGY:
"We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal"

And when I meet Thomas Jefferson
I’mma compel him to include women in the sequel
