####The Adams Administration####

BURR:
How does Hamilton,
the short-tempered, protean creator
of the coast guard,
founder of the New York Post
ardently abuse his cabinet post
destroy his reputation?
Welcome folks, to the Adam’s Admistration.
Jefferson’s the runner-up
which makes him the vice-president,

MADISON:
Washington can’t help you now,
no more Mr. nice President

BURR:
Adams fires Hamilton,
Privatley calls him creole bastard in his toss
Hamilton publishes his response.

JEFFERSON: 
Say what?

HAMILTON:
Sit down John,
you fat mother-fucker.

JEFFERSON:
Hamilton’s out of control,

MADISON:
This is great
He’s out of power,
he holds no office
and he just destroyed president John Adams
the only other significant member of his party

JEFFERSON:
Hamilton is a host unto himself,
as long as he can hold a pen,
he’s a threat.
Let’s let him know what we know.
